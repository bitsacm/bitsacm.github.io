### Intro:
This post discussed the rough timeline and resources for Python Summer Program - 2018 for BITS ACM Members

### Mentors:
[Rahul Bothra](https://github.com/Pro-Panda), [Ishan Bhanuka](https://github.com/twitu), [Divesh Uttamchandani](https://github.com/diveshuttam)

### Total Duration: 
7 / 8 weeks

### Timeline:
 - 1 wk: Understanding Basic Python Syntax
 - 2 wk: Understanding Libraries and their use (Importance will be demonstrated via giving tasks for creating small scripts)
 - 1 - 2 wk: Project 1 (Individual Project, but will be common for groups of 2 / 3)
 - 2 - 3 wk: Project 2 (Team Project for groups of 4 / 5)

The timeline is very flexible, for example, if someone is already comfortable with the basic syntax of Python, can directly jump to Understanding Libraries.

### Notes:
Instead of giving 1 large project with 1 mentor, we will give smaller projects (which can, and is recommended, to be their own ideas). Smaller projects ensure a sense of accomplishment.
Also, more than one project reduces the chances of a learner getting bored and will increase their learning horizons

The projects, (to be given at then end of 3 weeks) will be finalised at the end of 2 weeks, after judging everyone's interests, level of understanding, and feedback for project ideas( which they might get while learning in the first 2 weeks)
