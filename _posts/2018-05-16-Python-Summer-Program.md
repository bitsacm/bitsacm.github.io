### Intro:
This post discusses the rough timeline and resources for Python Summer Program - 2018 for BITS ACM Members

### Mentors:
[Rahul Bothra](https://github.com/Pro-Panda), [Ishan Bhanuka](https://github.com/twitu), [Divesh Uttamchandani](https://github.com/diveshuttam)

### Motivation to Learn Python:
 1. It helps you build things, **fast**. You can think of an idea and see it live, in a day.
 2. It is a bare minimum to do anything else. You must know basic Python to learn Ml, BackEnd Development or anything else
 3. It is very simple, yet very powerful

### Timeline:

**Total Duration:** 7 / 8 weeks

 - **1 wk:** Understanding Python Syntax
 - **2 wk:** Learning Libraries and their use (Tasks to make simple scripts)
 - **1 - 2 wk:** Project 1 (Individual Project, but will be common for groups of 2 / 3)
 - **2 - 3 wk:** Project 2 (Team Project for groups of 4 / 5)

The timeline is very flexible, for example, if someone is already comfortable with the basic syntax of Python, can directly jump to Understanding Libraries.

### Resources:
 - To understand Python Syntax:
   1. [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) OR,
   2. [Learn Python the hard way](https://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2015/python/LPTHW.pdf)


 - To practice libraries:
   1. [PyMotw](https://pymotw.com/3/)


 - Ideas for simple scripts:
   1. [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)


#### Notes for mentors:
Instead of giving 1 large project with 1 mentor, we will give smaller projects (which can, and is recommended, to be their own ideas). Smaller projects ensure a sense of accomplishment.
Also, more than one project reduces the chances of a learner getting bored and will increase their learning horizons

The projects, (to be given at then end of 3 weeks) will be finalised at the end of 2 weeks, after judging everyone's interests, level of understanding, and feedback for project ideas( which they might get while learning in the first 2 weeks)
