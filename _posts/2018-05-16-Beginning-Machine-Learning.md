* Will help you to get exposure to projects that are being implemented for industries and other competitions.  (Look Below)


## Post SIG Goals 

### Project : Unsupervised Human Action Recognition
* This is a part of a 2 crore project for a surveillance company in Mumbai.  This project will be very difficult, and very less research is currently available .  Hence all that we will be doing will be state of the art.  This is will be extremely fun because we will essentially be breaking into new domains of surveillance.  Anything that we do, will be absolutely original and has most probably never been tried before.
 
### Project : FIRE 2018 NLP Task 
* FIRE (Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation) is holding a competition this year among all major institutes like IIIT Hyderabad, BITS Pilani and some IITs.  I will involve you in this competition, this will make you proficient in implementing recurrent neural networks,data pre-processing,glove model and many other natural language related concepts. 

### First Sem Hackathon
* I will be choosing between 1 to 2 of you to accompany me in my team for an off-campus Hackathon.  This will provide you with enough exposure to how teams work, what’s essential to have in a team, how to strategize and so on...
